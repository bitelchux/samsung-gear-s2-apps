Apps targeting Gear S2 smartwatch I submitted as part of the "Devices per apps" (Dispositivos por Apps 2016) Samsung contest.

* Esnake: called "Serpiente" in Spanish Galaxy Apps store. The classic snake game with a little twist: the player uses the Gear S2 rotary bezel to move the snake around.

* PizzaSlicer: called "Cortapizzas" in Spanish Galaxy Apps store. A basic tool that lets you know how to get a concrete number of slices out of a pizza (or cake). Also controlled using the Gear S2 rotary bezel.
